This is my firm Machine Leaning project. The objectives of the project are as follows:
End to end predictive modeling machine learning problem 
 How to work through a regression predictive modeling problem end-to-end.
 How to use data transforms to improve model performance.
 How to use algorithm tuning to improve model performance.
 How to use ensemble methods and tuning of ensemble methods to improve model perfor-
